## Exploratory Data Analysis on Books Sales and Ratings
This repository showcases my EDA skills. I've used Kaggle's [Books Dataset: Analyzing Sales, Ratings, and Genres](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/books-sales-and-ratings) and made up an imaginary mid-sized publishing company called Evergreen Publishing Inc. who has reached out to me as a data analyst to help with optimizing their marketing strategies to boost their book sales and improve reader engagement.

Tools used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
